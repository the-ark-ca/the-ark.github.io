    <h1>Welcome to The Ark</h1>
    <p>The Ark is a tool to help.  It is also a place to express yourself without being concerned about who sees you.</p>
    <p>The Ark uses the latest in deep learning technology to hide your identity - image and voice, to keep you safe while 
    you share your mental health challenges, or life challenges in general.</p>
    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>The Ark is a safe place to ask for help.  It follows the principles laid out at www.theunitedfederationofplanets.ca.</p>
    <p>We use technology to find solutions that are beyond the capacity of generally accepted solutionsets and human-centric 
    problem solving.  We use AI and robots to analyze trends, facts, and state-of-the-art, in order to push the
    state-of-the-art.</p>
    <h2>Parting Words</h2>
    <p>This is an alpha site.  The real site will be here shortly. =)</p>
